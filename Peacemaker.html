<tr><td>I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose.</td></tr>
<tr><td>I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Mostly, we authors must repeat ourselves-that's the truth. We have two or three great and moving experiences in our lives-experiences so great and moving that it doesn't seem at the time that anyone else has been so caught up and pounded and dazzled and astonished and beaten and broken and rescued and illuminated and rewarded and humbled in just that way ever before.</td></tr> 

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr> 

<tr><td>Then we learn our trade, well or less well, and we tell our two or three stories-each time in a new disguise-maybe ten times, maybe a hundred, as long as people will listen.</td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr> 

<tr><td>If this were otherwise, one would have to confess to having no individuality at all. And each time I honestly believe that, because I have found a new background and a novel twist, I have really got away from the two or three fundamental tales I have to tell. But it is rather like Ed Wynn's famous anecdote about the painter of boats who was begged to paint some ancestors for a client. The bargain was arranged, but with the painter's final warning that the ancestors would all turn out to look like boats.</td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr> 

<tr><td>When I face the fact that all my stories are going to have a certain family resemblance, I am taking a step toward avoiding false starts. If a friend says he's got a story for me and launches into a tale of being robbed by Brazilian pirates in a swaying straw hut on the edge of a smoking volcano in the Andes, with his fiancee bound and gagged on the roof, I can well believe there were various human emotions involved; but having successfully avoided pirates, volcanoes and fiancees who get themselves bound and gagged on roofs, I can't feel them. Whether it's something that happened twenty years ago or only yesterday, I must start out with an emotion-one that's close to me and that I can understand.</td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>


<tr><td>The sight is the richest sensation humanity owns.</td></tr>
<tr><td>When we try to explain something, we often draw a figure to visualize the contents for an explanation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>The role of geometry in mathematics is not so much to give an answer to a problem, since providing an answer to a mathematical question by calculation etc., is usually the role of algebra.</td></tr>
<tr><td>The role of the geometer is to say what the answer (often a number) means.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Geometry in that sense is not so practical since the answer is given anyway. </td></tr>
<tr><td>However, humankind is unable to understand a complicated and chaotic calculation. </td></tr>
<tr><td>We need something-a notion, a concept, or a vision-to understand why we calculate that way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>That is, I think, the role of geometry in mathematics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Figures appearing in modern mathematics are usually beyond the ability of one's eyesight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Nevertheless, we visualize important concepts too complicated to understand without geometric meaning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>It is amazing how much we (people studying modern mathematics) came far away from our physical eyesight, free from restriction of the human body, as does modern science and technology. </td></tr>
<tr><td>The frontier of science and technology requires reaching beyond the border of our imagination, which, I believe, modern geometry can provide.</td></tr>
