Totality of rational points on modular curves - Tension between integers and polynomials

I met Sir Michael Atiyah at 5th HLF in 2017. After hearing what I was working on for my doctorate, he laughed and said "That's all child's play, you have geometry over function fields!" (he followed that up with telling me to think about 'Arithmetic Physics' for my career). I now see that he was right. 
In this course, I will endeavor to show you the simplest versions of ideas and connections of topics in the Title.
